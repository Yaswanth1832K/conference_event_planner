# 📅 Conference Event Planner

A web application for planning and managing conferences, including scheduling sessions, organizing speakers, and managing attendees.

> This project is based on the IBM Developer Skills Network open-source project.
> I studied the codebase, set up the project locally, and explored its architecture to understand full-stack web application structure and event-management workflows.
